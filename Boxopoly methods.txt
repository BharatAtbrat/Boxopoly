Main window has four sections 
each section has four blocks each pertaining to around 1 hr of ingame time (1 min irl)

Players get four house types to build from and are allowed to place one house 
in each block of the section one by one 
Each house has a different multiplier bonus and each block has random increasing or decreasing 
point values 
Second player can place a house on top of the previous players house with the condition that it 
comes at a cost of a 50 percent chance that he wont be able to place it and his house may be 
placed in a place with a decrement of points 

Each house placement has a timer duration of 15 seconds and the players have to wait 
until the next timer to place houses again 

After realtime of 1 minute the sections are changed and the current scores are displayed to the 
players 

This goes on for four sections and the game concludes displaying the final results of the game 
in another window where the user has the option to restart the game or exit
